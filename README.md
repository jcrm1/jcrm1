### Hi!

I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at Purdue. I have worked on a variety of projects, both through my university and on my own.

Among other things, here are some of the projects I am working on or have worked on in the past:
 - 3DeSktop/threedsmirror, a client/server pair that streams your macOS desktop to your 3DS (a handheld game console)
 - rocket_league, a project (that I am currently leading) through Purdue's Autonomous Robotics Club to make scaled-down cars play soccer autonomously
 - 3DSUSBController, a three-part project that turns your 3DS into a wireless USB game controller
 - ROSCC, a modification for the video game Minecraft that bridges it with ROS to help teach ROS to new members of Purdue ARC  

You can see these projects (and more!) in my profile below.

I also enjoy security research for macOS and iOS!

I recently entered a CTF for the first time with Purdue b01lers. My team got sixth. It was fun- I'd definitely like to enter one again!
