### Hi!

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Purdue University. I have worked on a variety of projects, both through my university and on my own.

Among other things, here are some of the public projects I am working on or have worked on in the past:
 - syscall_intercept, a project to port a Linux userspace syscall intercepting library from x86_64 to RISC-V (specifically, riscv32)
 - rocket_league, a project I lead through Purdue's Autonomous Robotics Club to make scaled-down cars play soccer autonomously.
   - We restarted the project from the ground up! If you are interested, please get in touch via [Purdue ARC](https://purduearc.com)!
 - 3DeSktop and threedsmirror, a client/server pair that streams your macOS desktop to your 3DS (a handheld game console)
 - 3DSUSBController, a three-part project that turns your 3DS into a wireless USB game controller
 - ROSCC, a modification for Minecraft that bridges it with ROS to help teach ROS to new members of Purdue ARC (available on the [`purdue-arc`](https://github.com/purdue-arc) GitHub page)
 - Several browser extensions
 - Create New Age unofficial v1.1.3 with improved electricity and heat distribution performance ([on my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jcrm1/create-new-age-newnetworks/-/tree/forge?ref_type=heads))
   - I doubled performance with power grids by rewriting the electricity engine to *not* run BFS several times every tick! Gameplay changes are in the repository description.

You can see these projects (and more!) in my profile below.

I also enjoy working with macOS and iOS internals!
