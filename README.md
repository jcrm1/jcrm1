### Hi!

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Purdue University. I have worked on a variety of projects, both through my university and on my own.

Among other things, here are some of the projects I am working on or have worked on in the past:
 - rocket_league, a project that I am currently leading through Purdue's Autonomous Robotics Club to make scaled-down cars play soccer autonomously. If you're interested in this, check out the `ros-2-complete` branch where the latest code can be found. (available on the [`purdue-arc`](https://github.com/purdue-arc) GitHub page)
 - 3DeSktop and threedsmirror, a client/server pair that streams your macOS desktop to your 3DS (a handheld game console)
 - 3DSUSBController, a three-part project that turns your 3DS into a wireless USB game controller
 - ROSCC, a modification for Minecraft that bridges it with ROS to help teach ROS to new members of Purdue ARC (available on the [`purdue-arc`](https://github.com/purdue-arc) GitHub page)

You can see these projects (and more!) in my profile below.

I also enjoy working with macOS and iOS internals!
